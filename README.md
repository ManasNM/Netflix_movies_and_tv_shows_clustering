# Netflix_movies_and_tv_shows_clustering

Description:
This project aimed to cluster Netflix's movie and TV show catalog to better understand content groupings based on attributes like genre, release year, and runtime. By clustering the content, the goal was to uncover patterns and similarities that could assist Netflix in recommending content more effectively.

Algorithms/Techniques Used:
K-Means Clustering: Used for clustering movies and TV shows based on features like genre, duration, and year of release.
Content-Based Filtering: Explored as a recommendation approach for similar movies and shows.
Elbow Method: Determined the optimal number of clusters.
Silhouette Analysis: Used to assess the quality of the clusters.
Conclusion:
The clustering analysis revealed several clear groupings, such as:

Short-duration comedies.
Longer dramas and thrillers.
Older classics and documentaries. These clusters can help Netflix enhance their recommendation systems, suggesting content that better matches user preferences, improving engagement and satisfaction.
